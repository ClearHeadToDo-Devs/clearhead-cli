# ClearHead CLI
This is meant to be both the reference and primary implementation of the clearhead framework using a few structures here:
- a library for usage in other contexts 
- a cli for usage in scripts
- a sync client to get the changes from other computers
- a sync server when necessary to serve local changes to other servers
- a formatter for our existing files
